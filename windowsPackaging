These are the steps for creating a packaged version for Windows.

Build OS: Windows 7 64 bit

Build for 64 bit:
* Download and install Python-2.7 (64 bit version)
	* Download from [here](python.org/downloads)
	* Make sure to set the "Add to path"-option during install
* Download and install PyWin32 (64 bit version)
	* Download from [here](github.com/mhammond/pywin32/releases)
* Download Microsoft C++ Redistributables
	* vcredist_x86.exe (why not x64_86?)
	* Install
* Install dependencies from Christoph Gohlkes archive
	* Download packages from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)
	* Numpy
	* OpenCV 2.4
	* zmq
	* VTK 5.10
	* PyQt4
	* Pillow
	* pyserial
	* Install each of them using pip install <package-name>
* Install pyInstaller using pip -install pyinstaller
* Add paths to C:\Python27\Libs\site-packages\vtk / Qt4 etc to PATH
* Better (????): Add path to C:\Python27\Libs\site-packages to PATH

* Modify C:\Python27\Libs\PyInstaller\hooks\hook-pythonvtk.py to C:\Python27\Libs\site-packages\PyInstaller\hooks\hook-vtk.py and comment last two lines of C:\Python27\Libs\site-packages\vtk\__helper.py
according to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21835851/python-executable-with-vtk-pyinstaller-py2exe-cx-freeze-etc) Otherwise vtk will not be imported correctly during packaging

* Copy C:\Python27\Libs\site-packages\zmq\libzmq.pyd to C:\Python27\Libs\site-packages\zmq\backend\cython according to [this issue](https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq/issues/999)
* Finally, run pyinstaller --onefile monkeyprint.spec from monkeyprint directory
* Copy monkeyprint.exe from the dists/monkeyprint folder to the base dir and delete dists and build folders
* monkeyprint.exe is ready to ship



Build for 32 bit:
* Run all of the steps as above with the following exceptions:
	* During Python install
		* Set install directory to C:\Python27x86
		* Make sure that "Install extensions" is not checked
		* Make sure that "Add to path" is not checked
		&rarr; This will install Python 32 bit to it's own directory without interfering with the 64 bit installation
	* Download the 32-bit version of PyWin32
	* Download the 32-bit libraries fomr Christoph Gohlkes archive
	* Install them using C:\Python27x86\Scripts\pip.exe install <package-name> so they end up in the 32 bit python directory
	* Install pyInstaller with C:\Python27x86\Scripts\pip.exe install pyinstaller
	* *Replace* the package locations in PATH to point to C:\Python27x86 instead of C:\Python27. This seems kind of hacky, dependencies should probably be included in the spec file in the future...
